<Highlight type="tip">

If you intend on migrating more than 400 GB, open a support request to ensure that enough disk is pre-provisioned on your Timescale instance.

If you get stuck, you can get help by either opening a support request, or take
your issue to the `#migration` channel in the [community slack](https://slack.timescale.com/),
where the developers of this migration method are there to help.
