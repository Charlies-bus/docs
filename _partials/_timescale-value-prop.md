Timescale works for you end-to-end. Converting your PostgreSQL tables to
hypertables instantly improves query and insert performance, and gives you
immediate access to continuous aggregates and compression. Continuous aggregates
continuously and incrementally materialize your aggregate queries, giving you
updated insights as soon as new data arrives. Compression immediately improves
database performance and, with usage-based storage, also saves you money. Pair
all this with data tiering to automatically archive older data, saving money,
but retaining access when you need it. Need to know more? Keep reading, and

step of the way.
