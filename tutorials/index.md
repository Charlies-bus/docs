# Implement engineering use cases

Timescale tutorials are designed to help you get up and running with Timescale
fast. They walk you through a variety of scenarios using example datasets, to
teach you how to construct interesting queries, find out what information your
database has hidden in it, and even gives you options for visualizing and
graphing your results.

* [Analyze bitcoin transactions][analyse-bitcoin-transactions]: Use Timescale hyperfunctions to analyze Bitcoin transactions
* **Analyze energy consumption data**: construct queries that look at how many watts were consumed, and when
* **Ingest real-time financial websocket data**: set up data pipelines that ingest real-time financial data into 
  your Timescale Cloud service.
* **Plot geospatial NYC taxi cab data**: examine where rides are originating from.
* **Real time analytics use case**: something cool.
* **AI use case**: get the idea?
